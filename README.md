# Amazon-Reviews-Analysis

Amazon is a leading E-commerce company in the world. Due to high internet penetration, online shopping has become the new norm for shopping. However, most customers tend to purchase products based on the reviews posted on sites like Amazon. Companies can look into these reviews and find out what problems the customers are facing and what they want.

In this project, we will analyze the product reviews on Amazon and try to find some insights. I've used PostgreSQL and PowerBI for this project.

We will try to understand the following insights from the data:

  Number of reviews across the years
  
  Number of reviews across different categories
  
  Average rating across different categories
  
  Frequency of best and worst ratings across the years
  
  Verified and unverified reviews
  
  Votes received for reviews
